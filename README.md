# 🎓 TA Management System  
### Streamlining University Teaching Assistant Operations

A modern full-stack web platform that centralizes Teaching Assistant (TA) assignment, tracking, and performance monitoring in one secure system.

Built to replace inefficient spreadsheets and manual coordination with a structured, role-based solution.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project?

University courses often manage TAs manually, leading to:

- Poor visibility on workload  
- No centralized performance tracking  
- Inefficient communication  
- Security concerns with shared documents  

This platform solves those issues through a secure, database-driven web system.
